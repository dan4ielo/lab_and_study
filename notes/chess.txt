Pieces API is now complete

What is left is to create tests for the software and see if there are going to be bugs.
It is imperative to check edge cases such as pieces being on the edge of the board and
or movement in one place. 

Build the board in terminal and see if you can display all legal moves for each piece. 
If successful, start building the actual GUI of the project.
