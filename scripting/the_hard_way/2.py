#This is an excersize about how do we comment in Python
#Comments are used so we can read our programm later a bit easier then it would be otherwise

print ("This is a code that is followed by a comment") #This comment follows the code and allows to add details about a specific line

#We can also use the comments to disable lines od code that we don't want to run

#print ("This is a line that has been commented out")
print ("This is a line that hasn't been commented out")
