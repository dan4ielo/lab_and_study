Chess game:
  1. Goals

  The end goal is to create a small platform on which one can play chess with
  friends. To do that the project needs a few basic things:
      - chess game - an engine that allows you to move pieces and see the state
of the board.
      - logging system - this is a section that needs to be researched, but the
basics are that we are going to need to comunicate with a database of users that
want to play the game.
      - code visualization - an interesting idea that can be used during interviews
      - flask/jango - use of common frameworks for the creation of a web interface

  2. Steps

  The steps that will be taken to achieve the wanted outcome.
      - build the engine
      - create the web interface
      - setup hosting for the project - so it can be accessed during interviews
      - setup a small DB (not really sure if it will be needed)
      - containerize the app and make it destributable
      - create a vizualization section that will be present when interviewing

This file is the begining of this project and will focus on the game engine

Structure
	class Engine
	class Piece:
	|_ class Pawn
	|_ class Knight
	|_ class Bishop
	|_ class Rook
	|_ class Queen
	|_ class King
	class Board

Functions
        class InvalidMove(Exception):
        class INvalidPieceCharacteristic(Exception):
	class Engine:
	  - start()       - start a new game with all needed pieces, intiate a
									 new board 
	  - start_pos()   - start from a given position - useful for puzzles
	
	class Piece:
	  
          # Operational parameters

          *file           - the x coordinates of the object (between a and h)
	  *rank           - the y coordinates of the object (between 1 and 8)
	  *COLOR          - enum value that shows a piece's color
          
          # Validation parameters

          valid_ranks     - list of valid entries for ranks
          valid_files     - list of valid entries for files
          
          # Verification functions - verify that the value complies with the expected

          - verify_rank()
          - verify_file()
          - verify_color()
	  
          # Operational functions - functions used for playing

          - location()    - get the location of the piece; returns the coordinates
        	                                                    of the piece
	  - verify_move()  - check for legal moves; returns the coordinates of the 
	                                                            legal moves
	  - move()        - change the coordinates based on legal moves
	
	class Board:
	  *ID             - identification number of the board - make it a hash
						  value to experiment with hashes?
	  *pieces         - create all pieces as objects and use the variables
                                                as a way to communicate with them
	  - read_chess()  - extract all information from chess notations (remember to
	            to turn all elements of the list in strings - security and failure)
	  - game_state()  - get the current location of all pieces in the game.
	  - king_check()  - check if any of the kings are in check; return True 
									 or False
	  | - check_moves()   - check if there are any legal moves possible; return
	a dictionary with possible move {'queen': a7, 'rook': a6} for example; return
	end of game signal if no moves are possible to def the king
	  - end_game()    - ends the game and determines a winner
